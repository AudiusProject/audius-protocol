An Audius Discovery Provider is a service that indexes the contents of the Audius contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, for Audius users to query. The indexed content includes user, track, and album/playlist information along with social features. The data is stored for quick access, updated on a regular interval, and made available for clients via a RESTful API.

For detailed instructions on how to develop on the service, please see [The Wiki](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/wiki/Discovery-Provider-‐-How-to-run#running-for-development).
