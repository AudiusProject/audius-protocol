# Audius Ethereum smart contracts

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/AudiusProject/audius-protocol)

Audius has two sets of contracts - the one in this directory, which runs on Ethereum mainnet in
production, and the one
[here](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/master/contracts) which runs on POA
mainnet in production.

The smart contracts in this directory implement the Audius ERC-20 token, staking functionality, service
provider registration, delegator support and off-chain service version management. For a
more in depth look at the contracts and architecture, please see the
[Audius Ethereum Contracts Wiki](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/wiki/Ethereum-Contracts-Overview)
page.

The two sets of smart contracts do not interact with one another, but both sets are used by end-user
clients and the off-chain services that run Audius to make use of their respective
functionality.
