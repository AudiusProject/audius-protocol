# Overview

An Audius Discovery Node is a service that indexes the metadata and availability of data across the protocol for Audius users to query. The indexed content includes user, track, and album/playlist information along with social features. The data is stored for quick access, updated on a regular interval, and made available for clients via a RESTful API.

Design Goals

1. Expose queryable endpoints which listeners/creators can interact with
2. Reliably store relevant blockchain events
3. Continuously monitor the blockchain and ensure stored data is up to date with the network

:::note

The Discovery Node may be referred to as the Discovery Provider. These services are the same.
