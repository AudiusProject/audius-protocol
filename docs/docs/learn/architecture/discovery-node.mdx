An Audius Discovery Node is a service that indexes the metadata and availability of data across the
protocol for Audius users to query. The indexed content includes user, track, and album/playlist
information along with social features. The data is stored for quick access, updated on a regular
interval, and made available for clients via a [RESTful API](/developers/guides/rest-api).

The Discovery Node source code is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose/tree/main/discovery-provider) and
see the [registered Discovery Nodes](https://dashboard.audius.org/#/services/discovery-node) on the
Audius Protocol Dashboard.

## Design Goals

1. Expose queryable endpoints which listeners/creators can interact with
2. Reliably store relevant blockchain events
3. Continuously monitor the blockchain and ensure stored data is up to date with the network

:::note Legacy Terminology

The "Discovery Node" may be referred to as the "Discovery Provider". These services are the same.

## Database

<!-- TODO: many of these GitHub links are broken -->

The Discovery Node uses PostgreSQL. Our Postgres database is managed through
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), an object relational mapper and
[Alembic](http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/index.html), a lightweight database migration
tool. The data models are defined in
[src/models](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/blob/main/packages/discovery-provider/src/models)
which is used by alembic to automatically generate the migrations under
[alembic/versions](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/main/packages/discovery-provider/alembic/versions).
You can find the connection defined between alembic and the data models in
[alembic/env.py](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/main/packages/discovery-provider/alembic/env.py)

## Flask

The Discovery Node web server serves as the entry point for reading data through the Audius
Protocol. All queries are returned as JSON objects parsed from SQLAlchemy query results, and can be
found in
[src/queries](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/main/packages/discovery-provider/src/queries).

Some examples of queries include user-specific feeds, track data, playlist data, etc.

## Celery

Celery is simply a task queue - it allows us to define a set of single tasks repeated throughout the
lifetime of the Discovery Node.

Currently, a single task `(src/tasks/index.py:update_task()`) handles all database write operations.
The Flask application reads from the database and is unaware of data correctness.

Celery [worker](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.worker.html) and
[beat](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.beat.html) are the key underlying
concepts behind Celery usage in the Discovery Node.

### Celery Worker

Celery worker is the component that actually runs tasks.

The primary driver of data availability on Audius is the 'index_blocks' Celery task. What happens
when 'index_blocks' is actually executed? The Celery task does the following operations:

1. Check whether the latest block is different than the last processed block in the ‘blocks’ table.

   If so, an array of blocks is generated from the last blockhash present in the database up to the
   latest block number specified by the block indexing window.

   Block indexing window is equivalent to the maximum number of blocks to be processed in a single
   indexing operation

2. Traverse over each block in the block array produced after the above step.

   In each block, check if any transactions relevant to the Audius Smart Contracts are present. If
   present, we retrieve specific event information from the associated transaction hash, examples
   include `creator` and `track` metadata.

   To do so, the Discovery Node _must_ be aware of both the contract ABIs as well as each contract's
   address - these are shipped with each Discovery Node image.

3. Given operations from Audius contracts in a given block, the task updates the corresponding table
   in the database.

   <!-- TODO: Audius Storage Protocol link? -->

   Certain index operations require a metadata fetch from decentralized storage (Audius Storage
   Protocol). Metadata formats can be found
   [here](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/blob/main/packages/discovery-provider/src/tasks/metadata.py).

:::info Why index blocks instead of using event filters?

This is a great question - the main reason chosen to index blocks in this manner is to handle cases
of false progress and rollback. Each indexing task opens a fresh database session, which means
database transactions can be reverted at a block level - while rollback handling for the Discovery
Node has yet to be implemented, block-level indexing will be immediately useful when it becomes
necessary.

### Celery Beat

Celery beat is responsible for periodically scheduling index tasks and is run as a separate
container from the worker. Details about periodic task scheduling can be found in the
[official documentation](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html).

This is an identical container as the [Celery worker](#celery-worker) but is run as a 'beat
scheduler' to ensure indexing is run at a periodic interval. By default this interval is
`5 seconds`.

## Redis

A [Redis client](https://redis.io/) is used for several things in the Discovery Node.

1. Caching (internally and externally)
2. As a
   [broker for Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/redis.html)
3. As a mechanism for locking to ensure single execution contexts for Celery jobs

## Elastic Search

Elastic Search is used denormalize data and support certain queries (Feed, Search, Related Artists,
etc.). Elastic Search data is populated and kept up to date by database triggers that live on the
Postgres database.

ETL code for the Elastic Search layer is found in the
[es-indexer](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/main/packages/discovery-provider/es-indexer).
