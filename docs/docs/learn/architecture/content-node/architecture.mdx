# Architecture

## Web Server

The Content Node's core service is a web server with an HTTP API to process incoming requests and
perform the following functions:

- user & track metadata upload
- user & track image upload
- user track file upload
- user & track data, metadata, and track file retrieval

_The web server is a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) [Express app](https://expressjs.com/)._

## Persistent Storage (Postgres)

It stores all data in a postgresql database and all images and metadata objects on its file system.

Pointers to all content and metadata stored on disk are persisted in the Postgres DB.

_Postgres is managed in the codebase using the [Sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/main/) which
includes migrations, models and validations_

## Redis

A [Redis client](https://redis.io/) is used for for resource locking, request rate limiting, and
limited caching and key storage.

_Redis is managed in the codebase through the [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) npm
package_

## Track Segmenting

As defined by the [Audius protocol](https://whitepaper.audius.co), the content node uses
[FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) to segment & transcode all uploaded track files before
storing/serving.

## Data Redundancy

As defined by the [Audius protocol](https://whitepaper.audius.co), all content is stored redundantly
across multiple nodes to maximize availability. This is all done automatically - every node monitors
every other node in the network to ensure minimum redundancy of all data, transfering files as
required.
