## Controllers and Nodes

A key feature of `audius-ctl` is the usage of configuration profiles to interact with and control
multiple Nodes from a single "Controller" over ssh.

Node Operators are able to manage all of their Nodes, or a subset of their Nodes, from a single
command line utility, rather than needing to access each Node directly to issue commands

Any computer or virtual machine can be a Controller, a laptop, a shared Virtual Private Server for
your team, or even the host machine running a Node itself. Only one Controller is needed, but Node
Operators can configure as many Controllers as they would like to suit their needs.

---

## Suggested Configuration

While it is recommended to use an additional machine as a Controller, but remember _any_ machine can
operate as a Controller.

> This example is a simple configuration where the Node Operator has configured one host machine as
> a Controller and uses it to access and mange a set of Nodes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Controller
  Z{{audius-ctl}}
  end

  subgraph VM 3
  C(Discovery Node 1)
  end

  subgraph VM 2
  B(Content Node 2)
  end

  subgraph VM 1
  A(Content Node 1)
  end

  Z-->A
  Z--->B
  Z---->C
```

---

### Controller on Host

In this configuration, the Node Operator configures each host machine to run a Node and its own
Controller.

In this example, the Node Operator has elected to use the machine marked `VM 1` to both run a Node
_and_ serve as the Controller for `VM 1`, and the same for each of `VM 2` and `VM 3`.

> This configuration can be useful for Node Operators looking to isolate Nodes from one another and
> reduce the security concerns that may arise from configuring multiple ssh access options.

```mermaid
  flowchart TD
    subgraph VM 3
    Z2{{Controller 3}}-->C(Discovery Node 3);
    end

    subgraph VM 2
    Z3{{Controller 2}}-->B(Content Node 2);
    end

    subgraph VM 1
    Z1{{Controller 1}}-->A(Content Node 1);
    end
```

To running `audius-ctl` and a Node on the same host first follow the
[audius-d config instructions](/node-operator/migration-guide/#5-edit-the-configuration-file) and
then edit your `/etc/hosts` file to map `localhost` to the Node URL

```bash showLineNumbers title="/etc/hosts file"
#/etc/hosts
127.0.0.1    content-1.example.com
    │                └── # THE URL OF THE NODE
    └── local host
```

---

### Multiple Controllers

In this configuration, a single Node is accessible from two different hosts acting as Controllers.

> This configuration can be useful when distributing access control to multiple users.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Controller 2
  Z2{{audius-ctl}};
  end

subgraph VM 1
  A(Content Node 1);
  end

  subgraph Controller 1
  Z1{{audius-ctl}};
  end

  Z1--->A;
  Z2-->A;
```

### Using a Virtual Private Server

Keep private keys secure by requiring users interacting with Nodes to log in to a Virtual Private
Server and issue commands from `audius-ctl` there.

> This configuration can be useful from a security and gatekeeping perspective, narrowing the access
> point to a single access machine which can be managed by multiple users.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

    u1([user 1])
    u2([user 2])
    u3([user 3])

    u1-->T
    u2-->T
    u3-->T

    subgraph Virtual Private Server
    T{{audius-ctl}}
    end

    subgraph Virtual Machine 2
    B(Discovery Node 2);
    end

    subgraph Virtual Machine 1
    A(Content Node 1);
    end

    T-->A;
    T-->B;
```

## Downing a Node

If for some reason you want to `down` an Audius Node, use the following command:

```bash
audius-ctl down
```

:::warning All together now

This command will down **ALL** of the Audius Nodes specified in the configuration. To down a single
node, pass the URL as an additional argument, like this:

```bash
audius-ctl down content-1.example.com
```

The same can be done with the `up` command when you are ready to start the Audius Node again.

## Content Node Storage Configuration

Content nodes support s3 compatible blob storage as an alternative to SSD storage.

Enter your information into each field for each Audius Content Node you will be running.

`/var/k8s/mediorum` on the host machine.
