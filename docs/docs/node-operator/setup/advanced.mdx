## Controllers and Nodes

A key feature of `audius-ctl` is the usage of configuration profiles to interact with and control
multiple Nodes from a single "Controller" over ssh.

Node Operators are able to manage all of their Nodes, or a subset of their Nodes, from a single
command line utility, rather than needing to access each Node directly to issue commands

Any computer or virtual machine can be a Controller, a laptop, a shared Virtual Private Server for
your team, or even the host machine running a Node itself. Only one Controller is needed, but Node
Operators can configure as many Controllers as they would like to suit their needs.

---

## Suggested Configuration

While it is recommended to use an additional machine as a Controller, but remember _any_ machine can
operate as a Controller.

> This example is a simple configuration where the Node Operator has configured one host machine as
> a Controller and uses it to access and mange a set of Nodes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Controller
  Z{{audius-ctl}}
  end

  subgraph VM 3
  C(Discovery Node 1)
  end

  subgraph VM 2
  B(Content Node 2)
  end

  subgraph VM 1
  A(Content Node 1)
  end

  Z-->A
  Z--->B
  Z---->C
```

:::tip Flexible Options

While it is recommended to use an additional machine as a controller, _any_ machine can operate as a
controller.

### Controller on Node

In this example, this Service Provider has elected to use the machine marked `VM 1` to both run a
node _and_ serve as the controller for all of their other nodes.

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    subgraph VM 3
    C(Discovery Node 1);
    end

    subgraph VM 2
    B(Content Node 2);
    end

    subgraph VM 1
    Z{{Controller}}-->A(Content Node 1);
    end

    Z--->B
    Z---->C
```

### Multiple Controllers

description text goes here

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Controller 2
  Z2{{audius-ctl}};
  end

  subgraph Controller 1
  Z1{{audius-ctl}};
  end

  subgraph VM 2
  B(Content Node 2);
  end

  subgraph VM 1
  A(Content Node 1);
  end

  Z1-->A;
  Z1-->B;
  Z2-->A;
  Z2-->B;
```

### Using a Virtual Private Server

Keep private keys secure by requiring users interacting with Audius Nodes to log in to a Virtual
Private Server and issue commands from `audius-ctl` there.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

    u1([user 1])
    u2([user 2])
    u3([user 3])

    u1-->T
    u2-->T
    u3-->T

    subgraph Virtual Private Server
    T{{audius-ctl}}
    end

    subgraph Virtual Machine 2
    B(Discovery Node 2);
    end

    subgraph Virtual Machine 1
    A(Content Node 1);
    end

    T-->A;
    T-->B;
```

### Downing a Node

If for some reason you want to `down` an Audius Node, use the following command:

```bash
audius-ctl down
```

:::warning All together now

This command will down **ALL** of the Audius Nodes specified in the configuration. To down a single
node, pass the URL as an additional argument, like this:

```bash
audius-ctl down content-1.example.com
```

The same can be done with the `up` command when you are ready to start the Audius Node again.

## Content Node

### Storage Configuration

Content nodes support s3 compatible blob storage as an alternative to SSD storage.

Enter your information into each field for each Audius Content Node you will be running.

`/var/k8s/mediorum` on the host machine.
