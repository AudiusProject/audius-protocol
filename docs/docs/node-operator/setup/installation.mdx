:::caution Already a Node Operator?

Do you currently run an Audius Node? Does `audius-docker-compose` sound familiar? If so, check out
the [📦 Migration Guide](/node-operator/migration-guide) to migrate your existing Audius Nodes to
the new architecture.

:::

## Overview

Installing and managing Audius Nodes is (in most cases) a 4 step process.

1. Install `audius-ctl`
2. Confirm your
   [ssh access and port configuration](/node-operator/setup/hardware-requirements#system-configuration)
3. Edit the configuration file
4. Run your Audius Nodes

---

## 1. Install `audius-ctl`

Get started by opening a terminal on a local machine, this can be any computer, such as a laptop or
desktop.

Run the following command to install the controller utility, `audius-ctl`

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.audius.org | sh
```

:::info Where to install audius-ctl

While it is recommended to install the controller utility on a separate computer, such as your
laptop, any machine can operate as a Controller. Check the
[Advanced Usage page](/node-operator/setup/advanced#audius-control-utility) for more information.

:::

## 2. Confirm ssh Access to Audius Nodes

For `audius-ctl` to interact with your Audius Nodes, your local machine will need ssh access.

Read more about configuring
[ssh access and port configuration here.](/node-operator/setup/hardware-requirements#system-configuration)

---

## 3. Edit the Configuration File

Next you will need to edit the configuration file. Run the following command to get started:

```bash
audius-ctl config edit
```

### 3.1 Configuration Details

The configuration file will be pre-populated with the required fields. Enter your information into
each field for each Audius Node you will be running.

```bash showLineNumbers title="audius-ctl configuration file"
network:
  deployOn: mainnet
nodes:
  content-1.example.com:        # <--- THE URL OF YOUR CONTENT NODE
    type: content
    privateKey: abc123          # <--- UNIQUE PRIV KEY USED BY THIS NODE TO SIGN RESPONSES
    wallet: 0xABC123            # <--- UNIQUE WALLET ADDRESS OF ABOVE PRIV KEY
    rewardsWallet: 0xABC123     # <--- ADDRESS OF WALLET HOLDING STAKED TOKENS
  discovery-1.example.com:      # <--- THE URL OF YOUR DISCOVERY NODE
    type: discovery
    privateKey: abc123          # <--- UNIQUE PRIV KEY USED BY THIS NODE TO SIGN RESPONSES
    wallet: 0xABC123            # <--- UNIQUE WALLET ADDRESS OF ABOVE PRIV KEY
    rewardsWallet: 0xABC123     # <--- ADDRESS OF WALLET HOLDING STAKED TOKENS
```

:::info Storage Configuration Options

[Content Node](/learn/architecture/content-node) Operators can use a variety of storage providers to
best suite their needs. Read the
[Storage Configuration](/node-operator/setup/advanced#storage-configuration) guide for more
information.

## 4. Run Your Audius Nodes

With the configuration file setup correctly, the final command to run is:

```bash
audius-ctl up
```

This command does a few things:

1. Loops over every Audius Node specified
2. Connects to each Virtual Machine via ssh
   1. Checks that the required Audius Node software is installed
   2. If not found, runs the installer
   3. Starts the Audius Node

:::tip monitoring nodes

Verify Nodes are up and properly configured by using the `audius-ctl status` command.

Read more about the status command at the [bottom of this page](#status-command).
