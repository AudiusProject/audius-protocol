# Service Level Agreements 🤝

In staking tokens and operating a service, you agree to adhere to meeting the Service Level Agreements defined in this document and ratified by the community by vote.

## 1. Minimum Version Guarantee

Audius protocol adheres to semantic versioning. Optional auto-upgrade tooling is provided for discretionary use to make compliance easy. https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose#upgrading

Ratified in governance vote: https://dashboard.audius.org/#/governance/proposal/128

### Major & Minor Versions

- Monthly cadence and/or upon major functionality changes
- Changes are ratified by voting on a governance proposal on the Audius [ServiceTypeManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9EfB0f4F38aFbb4b0984D00C126E97E21b8417C5#readProxyContract) smart contract. The governance proposals contains the version name and git commit SHA.
- Updating is compulsory within 24 hours of the proposal being enacted. Failure to comply will yield a recommendation of slashing 3,000 $AUDIO per service.
- Auto-update will upgrade service(s) automatically ✨🌈

### Patch Versions

- Weekly cadence under normal circumstances, priority security vulnerabilities and network halting issues may be published ad-hoc
- Updating is not compulsory and will not yield slashing recommendation, but is recommended to stay up to date with latest Audius patches, bug-fixes, and product improvements for the benefit of the ecosystem
- Auto-update will upgrade service(s) automatically ✨🌈
