# Introduction

This section describes how to run an Audius node.

The Audius protocol is powered by two off-chain services, the Discovery Node and the Content Node.

**Discovery Node**

- Indexes blockchains used by the Audius protocol \(Main-net Ethereum, POA, and Solana\)
- Serves API traffic
- Tracks usage metrics

**Content Node**

- Hosts audio and image content
- Syncs content across nodes to ensure data is consistent and highly available \(using the Audius Storage Protocol under the hood\)

Please join the node operator discord channel on the [Audius discord server](https://discord.com/invite/audius) for announcements & troubleshooting assistance.
