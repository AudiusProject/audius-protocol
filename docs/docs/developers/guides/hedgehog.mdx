> Build DApps Like Apps

---

Hedgehog is an open-source, client-side Ethereum wallet that uses a username and password. It aims
to lower the barrier of entry to crypto projects for non tech-savvy users.

Allow users to interact with your DApp just like they would any other website, no extensions
required, without centralizing control of keys.

Hedgehog is alternative to Metamask that manages a user's private key and wallet on the browser. It
exposes a simple API to allow you to create an authentication scheme to let users sign up and login
to their wallet across multiple browsers and devices.

## Not All Transactions Are Created Equal

Decentralized apps today require lots of technical knowledge to configure and use, limiting your
user base and reducing the potential for growth.

Currently available wallets treat every transaction as if it were moving around your life’s savings.
Hedgehog was built for use-cases involving low-to-no financial value.

## Is Hedgehog Right for your DApp?

:::note

The primary improvement to end-user experience is gained by hiding wallet complexity and not forcing
users to constantly confirm transactions - The opposite of what you’d want when moving significant
money around.

:::

Hedgehog isn’t right for every DApp. Massive improvements in user experience are only possible
through tradeoffs. As a general rule Hedgehog should not be used for apps involving significant sums
of money. As a bridge, one could start users on Hedgehog and suggest migrating to a more secure
wallet if their stored value increases beyond a certain threshold; the Hedgehog paradigm is
interoperable with existing web3 providers too.

### Good Use Cases

- **Signing data** - If you’re building decentralized applications that rely on user signed data
  (eg. via EIP-712-esque signing schemes), Hedgehog could help simplify the experience if the stakes
  are low enough.
- **Gaming DApp** - Nothing ruins fun as much as signing transactions. If you’re building a gaming
  DApp that doesn’t use significant financial assets, improving UX is key.
- **Decentralized Music Player** - If you’re building consumer-facing DApps, Hedgehog will
  dramatically improve user experience and significantly increase your potential userbase.

### Not So Good Use Cases

If your DApp involves moving around significant sums of money, then the tradeoff in security is most
likely not worth it. Hedgehog’s primary improvement to end-user experience is by hiding the wallet
and not forcing users to confirm transactions - The opposite of what you’d want when moving money
around. We absolutely don’t recommend using Hedgehog in situations like these:

- Banking DApp
- Decentralized Lending
- Prediction Markets

## A Closer Look

Hedgehog is a package that lives in your front end application to create and manage a user's entropy
(from which a private key is derived). Hedgehog relies on a username and password to create auth
artifacts, so it's able to simulate a familiar authentication system that allows users to sign up or
login from multiple browsers or devices and retrieve their entropy. Those artifacts, through
hedgehog, are persisted to a backend of your choosing.

:::note

A private key is only computed and available client side and is never transmitted or stored anywhere
besides the user's browser.

:::

```javascript
// Provide getFn, setAuthFn, setUserFn as requests to your database/backend service (more details in docs).

const hedgehog = new Hedgehog(getFn, setAuthFn, setUserFn)

let wallet

if (hedgehog.isLoggedIn()) {
  wallet = hedgehog.getWallet()
} else {
  wallet = await hedgehog.login('username', 'password')
  // or
  wallet = await hedgehog.signUp('username', 'password')
}
```

After creating or retrieving a user's wallet, you can either **fund their wallet directly** to pay
transaction fees or **relay their transactions through a EIP-712 relayer**.
