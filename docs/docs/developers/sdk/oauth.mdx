# OAuth

Enable users to either authorize your app to perform actions on their behalf (i.e. grant write
permissions), or simply verify who they are and give you access to their Audius profile info (no
write permissions granted).

## Methods

### init

#### init(`params`)

Enables the Audius OAuth functionality. Call this before using any other `oauth` methods.

**Params**

- successCallback `(profile: UserProfile, encodedJwt: string) => void` - function to be called when
  the user successfully authorizes or authenticates with Audius. This function will be called with
  the user's profile information, which is an object with the following shape:

  ```ts
  // `UserProfile` type:
  {
    userId: number; // unique Audius user identifier
    email: string;
    name: string; // user's display name
    handle: string;
    verified: boolean; // whether the user has the Audius "verified" checkmark

    /** URLs for the user's profile picture, if any.
    * If the user has a profile picture, three sizes will be available: 150x150, 480x480, and 1000x1000.
    * If the user has no profile picture, this field will be empty.
    */
    profilePicture: {"150x150": string, "480x480": string, "1000x1000": string } | { misc: string } | undefined | null
    apiKey: string | null // the API key for your application if specified
    sub: number; // alias for userId
    iat: string; // timestamp for when auth was performed
  }
  ```

  The second argument (`encodedJwt`) is for advanced use cases that want to pass the JWT to a
  backend for server-side verification.

- errorCallback _optional_ `(errorMessage: string) => void` - function to be called when an error
  occurs during the authentication flow. This function will be called with a string describing the
  error.

**Returns**: Nothing

**Example**

```js
audiusSdk.oauth.init({
  successCallback: (user) => console.log('Logged in user', user),
  errorCallback: (error) => console.log('Got error', error),
})
```

### renderButton

#### renderButton(`params`)

Replaces the element passed in the first parameter with the Log In with Audius button.

**Params**

- element `HTMLElement` - HTML element to replace with the Log In with Audius button
- scope _optional_ `'write' | 'read'` - Whether your app is requesting read or write permissions to
  the user's account. Specify "write" if you'd like the user to authorize your app to perform
  actions on their behalf, such as uploading a track or favoriting a playlist. Specify "read" if you
  simply need the user's email and profile information, and do not need any write permissions.
  Defaults to "read".
- buttonOptions _optional_ `ButtonOptions` - optional object containing the customization settings
  for the button to be rendered. Here are the options available:

  ```ts
  // type ButtonOptions =
  {
    // Size of the button:
    size?: "small | 'medium' | 'large'

    // Corner style of the button:
    corners?: 'default' | 'pill'

    // Your own text for the button; default is "Log In with Audius":
    customText?: string

    // Whether to disable the button's "grow" animation on hover:
    disableHoverGrow?: boolean

    // Whether the button should take up the full width of its parent element:
    fullWidth?: boolean
  }
  ```

  Use [this playground](https://9ncjui.csb.app/) to see how these customizations affect the button
  appearance and determine what config works best for your app.

:::note

The `write` scope grants your app permission to perform most actions on the user's behalf, but it
does NOT allow any access to DMs or wallets.

:::

**Returns**: Nothing

**Example**

```js
audiusSdk.renderButton({
  element: document.getElementById('audiusLogInButton'),
  scope: 'write',
  buttonOptions: {
    size: 'large',
  },
})
```

### login

#### login(`params`)

Opens the Log In with Audius popup, which begins the authentication flow. Use this if you have your
own link or button implementation, and don't want to use `renderButton`.

**Params**

- scope _optional_ `'write' | 'read'` - Whether your app is requesting read or write permissions to
  the user's account. Specify "write" if you'd like the user to authorize your app to perform
  actions on their behalf, such as uploading a track or favoriting a playlist. Specify "read" if you
  simply need the user's email and profile information, and do not need any write permissions.
  Defaults to "read".

:::note

The `write` scope grants your app permission to perform most actions on the user's behalf, but it
does NOT allow any access to DMs or wallets.

:::

**Returns**: Nothing

**Example**

```js title="script.js"
function logInWithAudius() {
  audiusSdk.oauth.login({ scope: 'write' })
}
```

```html title="index.html"
<button onclick="logInWithAudius()">Continue with Audius!</button>
```

### isWriteAccessGranted

#### isWriteAccessGranted(`params`)

Checks whether your app has write permissions to the given user's account.

**Params**

- userId `string` - User's Audius user ID

**Returns**: `Promise<boolean>`

**Example**

```js
async function hasSkrillexAuthorizedApp() {
  await audiusSdk.oauth.isWriteAccessGranted({ userId: 'eAZl3' })
}
```
