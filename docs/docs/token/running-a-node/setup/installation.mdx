# Installation

This guide describes how to run Audius services on a single machine via Docker Compose.
The repository of Docker Compose files can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose).

On a VM that meets the minimum requirements from above run:

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose/main/install.sh)
```

During installation there will be prompts for required environment variables. The variables are:

## Creator Node

- `creatorNodeEndpoint` - The DNS of your content node. If you haven't registered the service yet, please enter the url you plan to register.
- `delegateOwnerWallet` - Address of wallet that contains no tokens but that is registered on chain, used to sign JSON responses from server
- `delegatePrivateKey` - Private key associated with `delegateOwnerWallet`
- `spOwnerWallet` - Wallet that registered (or will register) the content node on chain

If you're using an externally managed Postgres DB please see [this section](/token/running-a-node/setup/advanced#external-discovery-provider-postgres-instance)

## Discovery Provider

- `audius_delegate_owner_wallet` - Address of wallet that contains no tokens but that is registered on chain, used to sign JSON responses from server
- `audius_delegate_private_key` - Private key associated with `audius_delegate_owner_wallet`

If you're using an externally managed Postgres DB please see [this section](/token/running-a-node/setup/advanced#external-discovery-provider-postgres-instance)
