# Claming Staking Rewards

Claims can be made via https://dashboard.audius.org by visiting the page for your service. If a claim is available, a "Claim" button will be displayed that allows you to submit the claim transaction.

Rewards can also be claimed by directly invoking the [DelegateManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4d7968ebfD390D5E7926Cb3587C39eFf2F9FB225#writeProxyContract) smart contract directly via the `claimRewards` method.

Rewards are available to claim weekly and submitting the transaction is a permissionless operation that any wallet may perform.
